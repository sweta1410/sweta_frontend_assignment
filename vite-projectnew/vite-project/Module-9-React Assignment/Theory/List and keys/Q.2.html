What are keys in React, and what happens if you do not provide a unique key?
Ans. What Are Keys in React?
Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed during 
re-renders. This identity allows React to optimize updates via its reconciliation 
algorithm.

A valid key should be:
Unique among siblings, ensuring React can tell elements apart,
And stable, meaning it doesn't change across renders.
