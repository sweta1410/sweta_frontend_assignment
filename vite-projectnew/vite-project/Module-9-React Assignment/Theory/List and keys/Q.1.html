How do you render a list of items in React? Why is it important to use keys when rendering lists?
Ans. How to Render a List of Items in React
example:

function ListComponent({ items }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map(item => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.text}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
You call .map() on the array (e.g. items.map(...)).

Inside the callback, you return a JSX element for each item.
The resulting list of JSX nodes is rendered directly inside, for example, a <ul>.
This pattern is widely shown in Reacts official documentation and tutorials. 

Why You Should Use key When Rendering Lists
React requires a key prop on each item in a list. Here's why it's so important:

1. Helps React Track Changes Efficiently
React uses the key to determine which items were added, changed, or removed between 
renders. This allows it to update only whats necessary in the DOM, rather than 
re-rendering everything.

2. Enables Predictable Updates When List Changes
Without stable keys, React may mix up item order or incorrectly reuse components. 
This could lead to confusing UI bugs or wrongly maintained internal state. 

3. Improved Performance
Using reliable keys (like unique IDs) avoids unnecessary remounting of components. 
If you use array indices as keys and then reorder or modify the list, React may waste effort recreating elements, degrading performance. 

4. Clarifies Intention â€” Developer-Friendly
Think of keys like stable street addresses for houses on a moving street. 
Without a consistent key, React cant confidently track the identity of each item.
