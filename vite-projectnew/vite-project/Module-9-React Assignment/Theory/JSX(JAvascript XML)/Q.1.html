What is JSX in React.js? Why is it used?
Ans. SX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, primarily used with React.js to describe the structure of user interfaces in a syntax that closely resembles HTML.

Why is it used:-
Declarative UI: JSX enables developers to write HTML-like code directly in JavaScript files, 
simplifying the process of building user interfaces. This approach makes it easier to visualize how components will render.

Cleaner Syntax: Compared to using React.createElement() for each element, JSX offers a cleaner and more concise syntax, 
reducing boilerplate code and enhancing readability. 

Dynamic Content: JSX allows embedding dynamic content within the UI by placing JavaScript 
expressions inside curly braces {}. This feature facilitates the rendering of dynamic data and content. 

Integration with JavaScript: JSX seamlessly integrates with JavaScript, allowing the use of variables, 
functions, loops, and conditionals within the markup. This integration provides the full power of JavaScript 
within the UI components. 

Transpilation with Babel: Since browsers do not understand JSX natively, tools like Babel 
are used to transpile JSX code into standard JavaScript.
