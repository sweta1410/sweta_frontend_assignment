Discuss the importance of using curly braces {} in JSX expressions.
Ans. Curly braces enable the inclusion of any valid JavaScript expression within JSX. 
This includes variables, function calls, arithmetic operations, and more. For example:

const name = 'Sweta';
<h1>Hello, {name}!</h1> // Renders: Hello, Sweta!

- When assigning dynamic values to attributes, curly braces are used to evaluate JavaScript 
expressions. 

-In JSX, inline styles are specified as JavaScript objects. Therefore, when applying inline 
styles, double curly braces are used: the outer pair for embedding the expression, and the
inner pair for the object literal.

-Curly braces facilitate conditional rendering within JSX. By embedding ternary operators
or logical expressions, components can render different outputs based on conditions.
