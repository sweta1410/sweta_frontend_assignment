How do you pass data to a component using props?
Ans. React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component
can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind 
you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, 
arrays, and functions.

Passing props in JSX:
Ex:
function App() {
  const user = { name: "SS", userId: "Xyz" };
  return <Profile person={user} size={100} />;
}

Receiving props in the child:
The child component receives a props object, which you can destructure:

function Profile({ person, size }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <img
        src={`#`}
        alt={person.name}
        width={size}
        height={size}
      />
      <h2>{person.name}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

 Destructuring:
 function Profile({ person, size = 80 })
