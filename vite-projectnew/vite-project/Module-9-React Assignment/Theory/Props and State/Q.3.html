Why is this.setState() used in class components, and how does it work?
Ans. In React class components, this.setState() is used to update the components 
stateâ€”an object that holds data that affects rendering. Its essential for changing 
state and making React re-render the component with updated data.

how it works: 
State can be updated in response to event handlers, server responses, or prop changes. 
This is done using the setState() method. The setState() method enqueues all of the updates 
made to the component state and instructs React to re-render the component and its children with the updated state.

Always use the setState() method to change the state object, since it will ensure that 
the component knows its been updated and calls the render() method.
