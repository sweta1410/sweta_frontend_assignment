Explain the concept of state in React and how it is used to manage component data.
Ans. In React, state is a built-in object that allows components to store and manage 
data that can change over time. It is a fundamental concept for building dynamic and 
interactive user interfaces.

How State Manages Component Data:
Local to the Component:
Each component instance on the screen has its own isolated state. 
If a component is rendered multiple times, each instance will maintain its independent state. 

Dynamic Data:
State holds information that can change during the component's lifecycle, often in 
response to user interactions (e.g., button clicks, form input), network requests, or 
other events.

Triggering Re-renders:
When a component's state changes, React automatically re-renders that component 
to reflect the updated data in the UI. This ensures the user interface stays in sync 
with the underlying data. 

Managing with Hooks (Functional Components):
In modern React functional components, the useState Hook is used to declare and manage 
state variables.
