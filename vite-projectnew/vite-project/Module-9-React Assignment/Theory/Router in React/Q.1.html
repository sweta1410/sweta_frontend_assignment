What is React Router? How does it handle routing in single-page applications?
Ans. React Router is a standard library for routing in React applications, designed to handle client-side routing in single-page applications (SPAs).
How React Router Handles Routing in SPAs

In traditional multi-page applications, each navigation to a new page results in a full page reload, fetching a new HTML document from the server. In contrast, SPAs load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content as the user interacts with the app. React Router facilitates this behavior by managing the application's routing on the client side.
Here's how React Router manages routing in SPAs:

Client-Side Routing: React Router intercepts navigation events and updates the browser's history stack using the HTML5 History API. This allows the URL to change without triggering a full page reload.

Route Matching: It matches the current URL to a set of defined routes and renders the corresponding React components. This is typically done using the <Routes> and <Route> components.

Dynamic Rendering: Based on the matched route, React Router dynamically renders the appropriate component, allowing for a responsive and interactive user interface.

Nested Routes: React Router supports nested routing, enabling the rendering of child components within parent components based on the URL structure.

Programmatic Navigation: It provides hooks like useNavigate to navigate programmatically within the application, useful for redirecting users after certain actions like form submissions.

URL Parameters and Query Strings: React Router allows access to URL parameters and query strings, facilitating dynamic content rendering based on the URL.

SPA Mode Pre-Rendering: React Router's SPA Mode allows for pre-rendering of the root route at build time into an index.html file. This approach improves performance and enables features like data loading for the application shell and server rendering capabilities.
