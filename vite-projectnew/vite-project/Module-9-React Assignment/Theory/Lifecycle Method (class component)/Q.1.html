What are lifecycle methods in React class components? Describe the phases of a 
componentâ€™s lifecycle.
Ans. Lifecycle methods in React class components are special methods invoked at 
specific points during a component's existence. These methods allow developers to 
control and react to changes in a component's state and props throughout its lifecycle.

* The lifecycle of a React component is divided into three main phases: 
Mounting:
This phase occurs when an instance of a component is created and inserted into the DOM.
constructor(): The first method called when a component is created. Used for initializing state and binding event handlers. 
static getDerivedStateFromProps(): Called right before calling the render method, both on initial mount and on subsequent updates. It's used to update state based on changes in props.
render(): Returns the JSX that defines the component's UI. It is a pure function and should not cause side effects.
componentDidMount(): Invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the DOM). This is a good place for data fetching, setting up subscriptions, or interacting with the DOM directly.

Updating:
This phase occurs when a component's state or props change, leading to a re-render.
static getDerivedStateFromProps(): (As described above)
shouldComponentUpdate(): Called before rendering when new props or state are being received. It allows you to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders if the component's output will not change.
render(): (As described above)
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(): Called right before the changes from the virtual DOM are reflected in the actual DOM. It allows capturing information from the DOM (e.g., scroll position) before it's potentially altered.
componentDidUpdate(): Invoked immediately after updating occurs. This is where you can perform side effects that depend on the updated DOM.

Unmounting:
This phase occurs when a component is removed from the DOM. 
componentWillUnmount(): Invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. This is the place to perform cleanup tasks like canceling network requests, removing event listeners, or clearing timers.
