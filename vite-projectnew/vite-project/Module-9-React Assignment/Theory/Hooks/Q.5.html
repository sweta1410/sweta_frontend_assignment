Whats the Difference between the useCallback & useMemo Hooks?
Ans. useMemo memoizes values. It takes a function and an array of dependencies. 
It then executes the function and returns the result of that function. This result 
is cached and only re-computed if any of the dependencies in the array change. 
This is useful for optimizing expensive calculations or data transformations.

    const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

useCallback memoizes functions. It takes a function and an array of dependencies. 
It then returns a memoized version of that function. This memoized function reference 
remains the same across re-renders as long as its dependencies do not change. 
This is primarily used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components that 
receive functions as props, especially when those child components are also memoized.

    const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
      doSomething(a, b);
    }, [a, b]);
