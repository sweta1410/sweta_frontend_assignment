Why do you need to bind event handlers in class components?
Ans. In React class components, binding event handlers is essential due to the
way JavaScript handles the this keyword. When you pass a method like this.handleClick as 
a callback (e.g., to an onClick prop), the method loses its original context unless 
explicitly bound. This means that inside the method, this may be undefined or refer to 
an unexpected object, leading to errors when trying to access component properties or state.

This behavior stems from JavaScript's function invocation patterns, not React itself. 
In JavaScript, the value of this inside a function depends on how the function is called. 
When a method is used as a callback, it often loses its context, resulting in this being 
undefined or pointing to the global object.
Ex.
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    // 'this' correctly refers to the component instance
  }

  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me</button>;
  }
}
