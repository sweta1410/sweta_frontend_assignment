How are events handled in React compared to vanilla JavaScript? 
Explain the concept of synthetic events.
Ans. 1. Abstraction and Synthetic Event System:
Vanilla JavaScript: Events are handled directly using native browser APIs like 
addEventListener to attach event listeners to DOM elements. The event object
passed to the handler is the native browser event.

    document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
        console.log('Button clicked!', event);
    });

React: React implements a "Synthetic Event System" that wraps native browser events into 
a cross-browser compatible SyntheticEvent object. This system provides a consistent 
interface for events across different browsers, abstracting away browser-specific quirks. 
Event listeners are attached declaratively within JSX.

    <!-- <button onClick={(event) => console.log('Button clicked!', event)}>
        Click Me
    </button> -->

2. Syntax and Declarative Nature:
Vanilla JavaScript: Event listeners are typically added imperatively, often after the 
DOM elements have been rendered.

    const button = document.createElement('button');
    button.textContent = 'Click Me';
    document.body.appendChild(button);
    button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
React: Event handlers are defined declaratively as props on JSX elements, using camelCase 
naming conventions (e.g., onClick, onChange). This integrates event handling directly into 
the component's structure.

    <!-- function MyComponent() {
        const handleClick = (event) => {
            console.log('Clicked!');
        };
        return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
    } -->

* Synthetic Events:-
Synthetic Events in React are objects that wrap around the browser's native events, 
providing a consistent API across all browsers. They mirror the W3C spec for native 
events and include standard methods like preventDefault() and stopPropagation(). 
This design allows developers to write uniform event-handling code without worrying 
about browser inconsistencies.
