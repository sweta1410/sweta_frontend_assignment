How do you handle forms in React? Explain the concept of controlled components.
Ans. Handling forms in React primarily involves managing the state of form input 
elements. This is commonly achieved through the concept of controlled components.

Controlled Components:
A controlled component in React is a form input element (like <input>, <textarea>, 
or <select>) whose value is controlled by React state. This means that:

State as the Single Source of Truth:
The current value of the input field is stored in and managed by a state variable 
within the React component.

value Prop:
The value prop of the input element is explicitly set to this state variable. 
This ensures that the displayed value of the input always reflects the current state. 
onChange Event Handler:
An onChange event handler is attached to the input element. Whenever the user types 
or interacts with the input, this handler is triggered.

State Update:
Inside the onChange handler, the new value from the input (typically e.target.value) 
is used to update the component's state. This state update then causes a re-render, 
and the value prop ensures the input reflects the updated state.
