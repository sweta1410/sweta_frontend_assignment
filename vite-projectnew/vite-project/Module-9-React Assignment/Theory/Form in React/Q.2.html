What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?
Ans. Controlled Components:
State Management:
The form data is entirely controlled by React state. The component's state is the 
single source of truth for the input's value.

Data Flow:
The input's value is passed down as a prop from a parent component, and changes 
are handled by an onChange event handler that updates the parent's state.

Predictability:
The component's behavior is highly predictable because its value is always dictated 
by the React state.
Advantages:
Easier to implement validation, real-time feedback, and manipulate the input's 
value programmatically.

* Uncontrolled Components:
State Management:
The form data is handled by the DOM itself, similar to how traditional HTML forms 
work. The component manages its own internal state.

Data Access:
To access the input's value, you typically use refs to directly interact with the 
DOM element.

Less Predictability:
The component's value is managed internally by the DOM, making it less predictable 
and harder to control programmatically.
Advantages:
Can be simpler to implement for very basic forms where real-time validation or 
complex data manipulation is not required.
