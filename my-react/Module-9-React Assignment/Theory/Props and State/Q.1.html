What are props in React.js? How are props different from state?
Props is a special keyword in React that stands for properties and is used for passing data 
from one component to another. Data with props are passed in a unidirectional flow from parent
to child. They are read-only, meaning a child component cannot directly modify the props it receives.

* how are propes different from state:
- Props are passed from a parent component to a child component, 
while state is managed within the component itself.
- Props are immutable (read-only) for the receiving component. State is mutable and 
can be updated by the component using methods like setState (in class components) or the 
useState hook (in functional components).
