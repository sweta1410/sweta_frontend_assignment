What is the role of render() in class components?
Returns JSX or React Elements: The render() method must return a single React element, 
which can be JSX, a string, a number, null, or an array of elements. This output dictates 
what appears in the UI. 

Pure Function: It should be a pure function, meaning it doesn't modify the component's 
state or interact with the browser directly. This ensures consistent and predictable UI 
rendering. 

Automatic Invocation: React automatically calls render() during the component's 
lifecycle, such as after mounting, updating, or when setState() is invoked. 
This keeps the UI in sync with the component's data.
