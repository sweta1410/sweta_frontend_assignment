What are the advantages of using React.js in web development?
Ans. Component-Based Architecture:
React promotes building user interfaces from isolated, reusable components. This modularity
simplifies development, enhances code reusability, and improves maintainability of complex 
applications.

Virtual DOM for Efficient Rendering:
React utilizes a Virtual DOM, a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM. 
This allows React to efficiently calculate and update only the necessary parts of the UI 
when data changes, leading to faster rendering and improved performance, especially in dynamic
applications.

Unidirectional Data Flow:
React employs a one-way data flow, making it easier to understand how data moves through the
application and predict how changes will affect the UI. This enhances code stability and 
simplifies debugging.

JSX for Declarative UI:
React uses JSX a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like 
structures directly within JavaScript code. This combines the power of JavaScript with the
familiarity of HTML, leading to more readable and maintainable UI code.

Large and Active Community:
React boasts a vast and vibrant community of developers. This provides extensive resources, 
documentation, tutorials, and readily available support, making it easier for developers to 
learn and troubleshoot issues.

Flexibility and Ecosystem:
As a JavaScript library, React offers great flexibility and can be integrated with various
other libraries and tools within the JavaScript ecosystem, such as Redux for state management
or React Native for mobile app development.

Testability:
The component-based nature and predictable data flow of React applications make them 
relatively easy to test, ensuring code quality and reducing the likelihood of bugs
