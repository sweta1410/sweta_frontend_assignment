Explain the core principles of React such as the virtual DOM and component- based architecture.
Ans. Virtual DOM:- 
React uses a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. 
When the state of a component changes, React updates the virtual DOM first. 
React then compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one using a diffing algorithm to
identify the minimal changes needed. 

Component-Based Architecture: 
Components can be used multiple times in different parts of an application.
Each component handles a specific piece of functionality, making the application more structured.
Large applications can be developed by assembling smaller, reusable components.
Updates and bug fixes are easier because changes are localized to specific components. 
React encourages composition, where components are combined to build complex UIs rather than relying on inheritance.
Data flows from parent to child components via props, making the data flow predictable and easier to debug.
Components should be built in a way that allows them to be reused across different parts of an application.
