Difference b/w HTML & HTML5?
Ans.  Differences between HTML and HTML5 are:

HTML: Older versions (HTML 4.01, XHTML)
Long and complex (<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">)
Requires Flash or other plugins for audio/video
Limited elements (e.g., no <article>, <section>)
Uses JavaScript for validation	
Needs third-party plugins (like Flash)
Not optimized for mobile devices

HTML5: Latest version with new features
Simple (<!DOCTYPE html>)
Supports <audio> and <video> without plugins
Introduces <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, <nav>
New input types (email, date, number, etc.)
Supports <canvas> for 2D drawing & SVG for vector graphics
Mobile-friendly with better responsiveness
