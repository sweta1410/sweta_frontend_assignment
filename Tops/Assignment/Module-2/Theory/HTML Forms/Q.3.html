What is the purpose of the label element in a form, and how does it improve accessibility?
Ans. The <label> element in an HTML form is used to associate a text description with a form control, such as an <input> field, <textarea>, or <select>. Its main purpose is to improve user experience and accessibility by clearly indicating what each input field represents.

How the label Element Improves Accessibility:-

1. Click Target Expansion:
When a <label> is properly associated with an input field, clicking on the label will focus the corresponding input. This is especially useful for small interactive elements like checkboxes and radio buttons.

2. Screen Reader Support:
Screen readers announce the label along with the input field, helping visually impaired users understand the purpose of the input.

3. Keyboard Navigation:
Users who navigate via keyboard or assistive devices can more easily interact with form elements when labels are correctly used.
