Explain the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission. When should each be used?
Ans. * GET Method :-

Data Visibility: Sends form data as URL parameters, making it visible in the browser's address bar.
Data Length: Limited by the URL length (generally around 2000 characters).
Caching: Can be cached and bookmarked since data is part of the URL.
Use Cases:
    -When retrieving data without causing side effects (e.g., search queries, filters).
    -When sharing URLs with pre-filled form data (e.g., Google search results).

* POST Method :-

Data Visibility: Sends form data in the request body, making it invisible in the URL.
Data Length: No significant limitations.
Caching: Not cached or bookmarkable.
Security: Safer for transmitting sensitive data like passwords (but should still use HTTPS).
Use Cases:
    - When submitting sensitive or large amounts of data.
    - When making changes on the server (e.g., user registration, payment processing).

* When to Use Each?
Use GET when the request does not modify server data (e.g., search queries, navigation).
Use POST when the request modifies or submits sensitive data (e.g., login, form submissions with personal details).
