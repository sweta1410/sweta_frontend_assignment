Explain the structure of an HTML table and the purpose of each of the following elements: <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>, and <thead
Ans. 1. <table> (Table Element) :-
    This is the main container that holds all the rows and columns of the table.
    It defines the table structure and can have attributes like border, cellspacing, and cellpadding.
    Example:-
    
    html
    
    <table border="1">
    </table>
    
    2. <tr> (Table Row):-
    Represents a single row within a table.
    It is used to group cells (<th> or <td>) into a horizontal row.
    Example:
    
    html
    
    <tr>
      <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
      <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
    </tr>

    3. <th> (Table Header):-
    Defines header cells in a table.
    Usually, these cells are bold and centered by default.
    Used to label columns or rows.
    Example:
    
    html
    
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
    </tr>

    4. <td> (Table Data Cell):-
    Defines a standard data cell within a table.
    Contains actual data for each row and column.
    Example:
    
    html
    
    <tr>
      <td>John</td>
      <td>25</td>
    </tr>

    5. <thead> (Table Head Section):-
    Groups all the header (<th>) elements together.
    Helps with table organization and accessibility.
    Example:
    
    html
    
    <table border="1">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Age</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>sweta</td>
          <td>30</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Ankita</td>
          <td>32</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
