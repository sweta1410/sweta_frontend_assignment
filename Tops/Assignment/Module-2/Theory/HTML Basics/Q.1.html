Define HTML. What is the purpose of HTML in web development?

Ans. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard language used to structure and present content on the web, providing the basic structure and framework of a webpage.

Purpose of HTML in Web Development:
Structuring Content: HTML defines the fundamental structure of a webpage, organizing content into headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, etc., to present the information in a logical and readable way.
Creating Semantic Content: HTML allows developers to add meaning and structure to content by using appropriate tags (e.g., <article> for an article, <nav> for navigation links).
Adding Multimedia: HTML enables developers to embed multimedia elements like images, videos, and audio, enriching the web page's content and user experience.
Linking to other Pages: HTML allows to create hyperlinks to other pages, enabling users to navigate across multiple pages of a website.
Working with other Technologies: While HTML defines the structure and content, technologies like CSS are used to enhance the visual presentation (styling), and JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.
