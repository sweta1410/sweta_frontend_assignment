Discuss the role of semantic HTML. Why is it important for accessibility and SEO? Provide examples of semantic elements.
Ans. The Role of Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML elements that convey meaning about their content and structure. Instead of using generic elements like <div> or <span>, semantic elements such as <header>, <article>, and <section> describe the purpose of the content, making it easier for both developers and machines (like search engines and assistive technologies) to understand the webpage.

   * Importance of Semantic HTML for Accessibility
    1. Enhances Screen Reader Navigation
        Assistive technologies rely on semantic elements to interpret the structure of a webpage. For example, a screen reader can quickly jump between <nav> for navigation, <main> for the main content, and <footer> for page-ending details.
    
    2. Improves Keyboard Navigation
        Users who rely on keyboard navigation can benefit from semantic elements, as they allow browsers to provide built-in focus behavior (e.g., <button> instead of <div> styled as a button).
    
    3. Provides Meaningful Content Organization
        Elements like <article> and <aside> help users understand how different sections relate to each other, improving the browsing experience for people with cognitive disabilities.
    
    * Importance of Semantic HTML for SEO
    1. Improves Search Engine Crawling & Indexing
        Search engines like Google use semantic elements to determine the context and relevance of content. For example, an <article> tag signals self-contained content, which can be indexed separately.
    
    2. Boosts Rich Snippets & Featured Results
        Proper use of semantic elements (combined with structured data) can improve the chances of appearing in rich snippets, voice search results, and featured snippets.
   
    3. Reduces Reliance on Excessive CSS & JavaScript
        Using semantic elements appropriately reduces the need for extra code, improving page load speed and overall SEO performance.
