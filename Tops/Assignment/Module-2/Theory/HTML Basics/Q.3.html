What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in HTML? Provide examples of each.

Ans. Block-Level Elements
- These elements take up the full width available (by default) and start on a new line.
- They create a "block" or a distinct section in the document.
- Commonly used for structuring the layout of a webpage.

* Examples of Block-Level Elements:

<div>This is a block-level element</div>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<ul>
    <li>List Item</li>
</ul>
<section>This is a section</section>

* Inline Elements
- These elements take up only as much width as necessary.
- They do not start on a new line; they stay within the same line as surrounding content.
- Typically used for styling and formatting text within block elements.

* Examples of Inline Elements:

<span>This is an inline element</span>
<a href="#">This is a link</a>
<strong>Bold text</strong>
<em>Italic text</em>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">
