What is React.js? How is it different from other JavaScript frameworks and libraries?
Ans. React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. 
It is a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI components that manage their
own state and rendering logic.

it different from other JavaScript frameworks and libraries:
React vs. Angular: Angular is a framework that provides a complete solution out of the box, 
including routing, state management, and form handling. React, being a library, focuses
solely on the view layer, giving developers the flexibility to choose additional libraries as needed. 

React vs. Vue.js: Vue.js offers a more opinionated structure with built-in features like 
directives and two-way data binding. React's unopinionated nature provides greater flexibility 
but may require more decisions regarding architecture and tooling. 

React vs. jQuery: jQuery simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling but doesn't provide a
structured approach to building complex UIs. React's component-based architecture and virtual 
DOM make it more suitable for building scalable and maintainable applications.
