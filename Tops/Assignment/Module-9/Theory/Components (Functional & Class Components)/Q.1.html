What are components in React? Explain the difference between functional
components and class components
Ans. In React, components are the fundamental building blocks for creating user interfaces.
They are reusable, self-contained pieces of UI that can be combined to build complex 
applications. Components receive data via "props" and return React 
elements, which describe what should be displayed on the screen. 

* Functional component:- 
These are simpler components defined as plain JavaScript functions. 
They accept props as an argument and return JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe the UI.
With the introduction of React Hooks in version 16.8, functional components can now manage
state and handle side effects, capabilities previously exclusive to class components.
Example:

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function User(props) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hello');
  return <h1>{message}, {props.name}!</h1>;
} 

  * Class Component:- 
Class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component.
They can hold and manage internal state and have access to lifecycle methods.
Example:
import React from 'react';

class User extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { message: 'Hello' };
  }

  render() {
    return <h1>{this.state.message}, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
