How is JSX different from regular JavaScript? Can you write JavaScript inside JSX?
Differences Between JSX and Regular JavaScript:
Syntax and Purpose: JSX allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript,
making it easier to visualize the component structure. Regular JavaScript doesn't support 
this syntax natively.

Transpilation Requirement: Browsers cannot interpret JSX directly. JSX code must be 
transformed into standard JavaScript using a transpiler like Babel before it can run in 
the browser. Regular JavaScript doesn't require this.

Integration with React: JSX is specifically designed to work seamlessly with React, 
enabling developers to define UI components declaratively. While React can be used without JSX, 
using JSX simplifies the code and enhances readability.

Yes, you can embed JavaScript expressions within JSX by enclosing them in curly braces {}.
