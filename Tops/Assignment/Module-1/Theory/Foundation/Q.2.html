Q.2 What is a Browsers? How they works?

Ans.  A browser (or web browser) is a software application used to access and interact with websites on the internet. It allows users to retrieve, display, and navigate web pages, images, videos, and other online content.
A web browser works through several steps when loading a webpage:
1. User Request (URL Input)
•	When you type a website address (URL) into the address bar (e.g., https://www.google.com) and press enter, the browser starts the process of loading the webpage.
2. DNS Lookup (Finding the Website’s Server)
•	The browser contacts a Domain Name System (DNS) server to convert the website's domain name (e.g., google.com) into an IP address (e.g., 142.250.183.206), which helps locate the website’s server.
3. Establishing a Connection (HTTP/HTTPS)
•	The browser uses protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with the web server.
•	If HTTPS is used, data is encrypted for security.
4. Sending a Request to the Web Server
•	The browser sends a request to the web server asking for the webpage's content.
•	The server processes the request and sends back HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resources.
5. Rendering the Webpage
•	The browser processes the received HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and renders them into a visual webpage.
•	The rendering engine (such as Blink for Chrome or Gecko for Firefox) interprets the code and displays the website.
6. Handling User Interactions
•	The browser lets users click links, submit forms, play videos, and interact with web applications.
