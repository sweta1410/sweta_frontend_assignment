Q. What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?

Ans. while Loop (Entry-Controlled Loop)
Condition Check: Evaluated before the loop body executes.
Execution Guarantee: The loop body may not execute at all if the condition is initially false.
Use Case: Ideal when the number of iterations is not predetermined and the loop should 
only execute if the condition is true from the outset.

Example:

int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;
}

* do-while Loop (Exit-Controlled Loop)
Condition Check: Evaluated after the loop body executes.

Execution Guarantee: The loop body executes at least once, regardless of the condition.

Use Case: Suitable when the loop must run at least once, such as prompting user input 
before validation.

Example:
int i = 0;
do {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
