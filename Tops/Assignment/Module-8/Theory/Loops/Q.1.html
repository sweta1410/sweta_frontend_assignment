Q. Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). Provide a basic example of each.
Ans.  In JavaScript, loops are essential for executing a block of code multiple times. 
The primary loop constructs are for, while, and do...while, each serving different
purposes based on the specific requirements of your code. Here's an overview of each, 
along with basic examples:

1. for Loop
Purpose: Ideal when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
}

Example:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("For loop iteration:", i);
}
Explanation: This loop initializes i to 0, checks if i is less than 5, 
executes the code block, and then increments i by 1 in each iteration.

2. while Loop
Purpose: Suitable when the number of iterations is not known and depends 
on a condition evaluated before each iteration.

Syntax:
while (condition) {
}
Example:
let j = 0;
while (j < 5) {
  console.log("While loop iteration:", j);
  j++;
}
Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as j is less than 5, 
incrementing j by 1 in each iteration.

3. do...while Loop
Purpose: Ensures that the code block is executed at least once, with the 
condition evaluated after each execution.

Syntax:
do {

} while (condition);

Example:
let k = 0;
do {
  console.log("Do-while loop iteration:", k);
  k++;
} while (k < 5);
Explanation: The code block executes once before checking if k is less than 5, 
ensuring at least one execution regardless of the condition.
