<!--What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?-->
== (Loose Equality)
Type Coercion: Before comparison, == converts the operands to the same type. This process is known as type coercion.

Comparison: After type conversion, it compares the values.

Example:
console.log("10" == 10); // Output: true
In this example, the string "10" is coerced to the number 10, so the comparison returns true.


=== (Strict Equality)
No Type Coercion: === does not perform any type conversion. It compares both the value and the type of the operands.

Comparison: If the operands are of different types, the comparison returns false.

Example:
console.log("10" === 10); // Output: false
