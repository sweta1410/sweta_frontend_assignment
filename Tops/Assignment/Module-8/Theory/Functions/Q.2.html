Q. What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?
Ans. Function Declaration:
Syntax:
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

Key Characteristics:

Hoisting: Function declarations are hoisted, meaning the function can be invoked before 
its definition in the code.

  sayHello(); // Outputs: Hello!

  function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
Named Functions: They must have a name, which aids in readability and debugging.

Scope: The function is scoped to the enclosing function or global scope.

* Function Expression:
Syntax:
const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
Key Characteristics:

Not Hoisted: Function expressions are not hoisted. Attempting to call them before their definition results in an error.

  sayHello(); // Error: sayHello is not a function

  const sayHello = function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  };
Anonymous or Named: They can be anonymous or named. Named function expressions are useful for recursion and debugging.
