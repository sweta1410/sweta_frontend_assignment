Q. What are functions in JavaScript? Explain the syntax for declaring and calling a function.
Ans. In JavaScript, functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. 
They help in organizing code, promoting reusability, and improving maintainability.

Declaring Functions in JavaScript:
There are several ways to declare functions in JavaScript:

1. Function Declaration
This is the most common method. It defines a named function using the function keyword.
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
Function declarations are hoisted, meaning they can be called before their definition in the code. 

2. Function Expression:

A function can also be defined and assigned to a variable. This method is known as a function expression.
const greet = function(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
};
Function expressions are not hoisted, so they cannot be called before their definition. 

3. Arrow Function Expression (ES6):
Introduced in ES6, arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions.

const greet = (name) => "Hello, " + name + "!";
Arrow functions do not have their own this binding and are not suitable for defining 
object methods. 

Calling Functions in JavaScript
To execute a function, you invoke it by using its name followed by parentheses. 
If the function requires parameters, you pass them within the parentheses.

Example:
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let result = add(5, 3); // result is 8
Alternatively, you can use the call() method to invoke a function with a specified this value and arguments provided individually.

function greet() {
  return "Hello, " + this.name;
}

const person = { name: "Alice" };
greet.call(person);
