Q. Discuss the concept of parameters and return values in functions.
Ans. Parameters in Java Methods
Parameters are variables listed in a method's declaration. They act as placeholders for the
values (arguments) that you pass to the method when invoking it.

* Declaring Parameters
Parameters are specified within the parentheses following the method name. 
Each parameter must have a defined type. For example:

public void greet(String name) {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
In this example, name is a parameter of type String. When you call greet("Alice");, 
the method will output:

Hello, Alice!

* Multiple Parameters
A method can have multiple parameters, separated by commas:

public void displayInfo(String name, int age) {
    System.out.println(name + " is " + age + " years old.");
}
Calling displayInfo("Bob", 30); will output:

Bob is 30 years old.
Parameters vs. Arguments
Parameters are variables in the method declaration.

Arguments are the actual values passed to the method when it is called.

For instance, in the call greet("Alice");, "Alice" is the argument corresponding to the parameter name.

Passing by Value
Java uses pass-by-value for method parameters:

Primitive types (e.g., int, double) are passed by value, meaning the method receives a copy of the value. Changes to the parameter within the method do not affect the original variable.

Object references are also passed by value, but the value is the reference to the object. This means that while the reference itself is a copy, both the original and the copy point to the same object. Therefore, changes to the object's fields within the method affect the original object.

Return Values in Java Methods
A return value is the result that a method sends back to the caller after execution.
Stack Overflow

Declaring Return Types
When defining a method, you specify its return type before the method name. If the method does not return a value, you use the void keyword.
Oracle Docs

public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
In this example, the method add returns an int value, which is the sum of a and b.

Using the return Statement
The return statement is used to exit a method and optionally pass back a value:

public boolean isEven(int number) {
    return number % 2 == 0;
}
Here, isEven returns a boolean indicating whether the input number is even.

 Void Methods
Methods declared with void do not return a value:
Oracle Docs

public void printMessage(String message) {
    System.out.println(message);
}
Such methods perform an action but do not provide a result to the caller.

 Returning Objects
Methods can also return objects:

public String getGreeting(String name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
