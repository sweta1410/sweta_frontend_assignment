Q. What is an object in JavaScript? How are objects different from arrays?
Ans. An object is a collection of properties, where each property is a key-value pair. 
Keys are strings (or Symbols), and values can be of any type, including other objects or functions. 
This structure allows objects to represent complex entities with various attributes and behaviors.

* Differences Between Objects and Arrays:
Feature	                  Object	                Array
Structure	        Key-value pairs	         Ordered list of elements
Key Type	        Strings or Symbols	     Numeric indices (0, 1, 2, ...)
Access Syntax	    obj.key or obj["key"]	 arr[0], arr[1], etc.
Use Case	        Representing entities    Managing ordered collections of data
                    with named properties	
Built-in Methods	Few (Object.keys(),      Many (push(), pop(), map(), filter())
                    Object.values())
