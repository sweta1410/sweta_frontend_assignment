Q. Describe how switch statements work in JavaScript. When should you use a
switch statement instead of if-else?
Ans. How switch Statements Work
The switch statement evaluates an expression and compares its result to the values specified in each case clause.
When a match is found, the corresponding block of code executes. If no match is found, the default block (if provided) executes.

Syntax:
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to execute if expression === value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to execute if expression === value2
    break;
  // Add more cases as needed
  default:
    // Code to execute if no case matches
}
Example:
const fruit = "Mango";

switch (fruit) {
  case "Apple":
    console.log("Apples are $1.00 each.");
    break;
  case "Banana":
    console.log("Bananas are $0.50 each.");
    break;
  case "Mango":
    console.log("Mangoes are $1.50 each.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Sorry, we don't have that fruit.");
}
In this example, the output will be:
Mangoes are $1.50 each.
