How is JavaScript different from other programming languages like Python or Java?

Ans. 1. Execution Environment:
JavaScript: Primarily runs in web browsers (client-side), though also used server-side with Node.js.
Python & Java: Typically run on servers or local machines, not directly in the browser.

2. Syntax and Language Design:
JavaScript: Loosely typed (dynamic typing), supports both object-oriented and functional styles.
Python: Also dynamically typed but emphasizes readability and simplicity (e.g., strict indentation).
Java: Statically typed, verbose, and fully object-oriented with strong OOP principles.

3. Compilation vs Interpretation:
JavaScript: Interpreted or just-in-time (JIT) compiled by browser engines like V8 (Chrome).
Python: Interpreted, with optional bytecode compilation.
Java: Compiled to bytecode, which runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

4. Typing System:
JavaScript: Dynamically typed, prone to type coercion issues ('5' + 1 results in '51').
Python: Dynamically typed, but more predictable and strict than JavaScript.
Java: Statically typed, with clear type declarations.

5. Concurrency Model
JavaScript: Uses an event loop with non-blocking, asynchronous execution (e.g., async/await, Promises).
Python: Traditionally synchronous, though it supports async (via asyncio).
Java: Uses multithreading with built-in concurrency tools.

6. Use Cases
JavaScript: Web development (frontend & backend), lightweight apps, interactive UIs.
Python: Data science, scripting, web backends, automation, AI/ML.
Java: Large enterprise applications, Android apps, backend systems.
