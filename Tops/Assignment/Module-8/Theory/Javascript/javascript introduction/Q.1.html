Q. What is JavaScript? Explain the role of JavaScript in web development.?
Ans. JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive and 
dynamic content on websites. It is one of the core technologies of web development, 
alongside HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

Role of JavaScript:-
Client-Side Interactivity:
JavaScript runs in the user's web browser and allows for the development of 
interactive features like:
Dropdown menus
Modal windows
Image sliders
Form validations
Real-time updates (e.g., auto-suggestions or chat interfaces)
DOM Manipulation:
JavaScript can access and modify the Document Object Model (DOM), 
which represents the structure of a web page. This allows developers to 
dynamically change the content and structure of web pages without reloading them.

Event Handling:
JavaScript allows developers to define custom behavior when users interact with a 
webpage (clicks, mouse movement, keypresses, etc.), enabling highly responsive user interfaces.

Asynchronous Operations:
Using APIs like fetch() or XMLHttpRequest, JavaScript enables asynchronous data
loading (AJAX), which allows parts of a webpage to update without a full page reloadâ€”commonly used in modern single-page applications (SPAs).

Integration with Backend:
JavaScript frameworks (like Node.js) can be used on the server-side to build full-stack 
web applications. This allows developers to use a single language across both front-end and back-end.

Rich Ecosystem and Frameworks:
JavaScript has a vast ecosystem, including libraries and frameworks such as:-
React, Vue.js, Angular (for building UI)
jQuery (for simplified DOM manipulation)
Node.js (for backend development)
