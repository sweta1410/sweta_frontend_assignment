Discuss the use of <script> tag in HTML. How can you link an external JavaScript file to an HTML document?

Ans. The <script> tag in HTML is used to embed or reference JavaScript code within a web page. 
   
Usage of <script> Tag:

Inline JavaScript: You can write JavaScript code directly inside the HTML document.
<script>
  alert('Hello, World!');
</script>
External JavaScript: You can link to a separate JavaScript file using the src attribute of the <script> tag.

<script src="script.js"></script>
Placement of <script> Tag
Traditionally, <script> tags were placed in the <head> section, but this could delay page rendering.

For better performance, they are often placed just before the closing </body> tag so the HTML loads
before the JavaScript runs.
Alternatively, the defer or async attributes can be used when placing scripts in the <head>:

defer: Executes the script after the HTML is fully parsed.
<script src="script.js" defer></script>

async: Executes the script as soon as it's loaded, without waiting for HTML parsing.

<script src="script.js" async></script>
Example of Linking External JavaScript

HTML File (index.html):
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
  <script src="script.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
</body>
</html>
JavaScript File (script.js):

javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
  console.log("Page is fully loaded.");
});
