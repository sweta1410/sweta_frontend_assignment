Q. Provide an example of how to use setTimeout() to delay an action by 2 seconds.
Ans. setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This message is displayed after 2 seconds");
  }, 2000);
  Explanation:
  
  setTimeout() is a built-in JavaScript function that executes a specified function 
  after a designated delay.
  
  The first argument is the function to executeâ€”in this case, an arrow function that 
  logs a message to the console.
  
  The second argument is the delay in milliseconds. Since 1 second equals 1000 
  milliseconds, 2000 milliseconds equates to a 2-second delay.
  
  When this code runs, it immediately sets a timer. After 2 seconds, the provided 
  function executes, logging the message to the console.
