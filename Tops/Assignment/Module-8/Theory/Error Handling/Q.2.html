Q. Why is error handling important in JavaScript applications?
Ans. 1. Enhances Application Stability
JavaScript's flexibility means that errors—such as undefined variables or failed API calls—are inevitable.
Implementing error handling mechanisms like try...catch blocks allows developers to manage these errors gracefully,
 preventing the application from crashing and ensuring a smoother user experience. 

2. Improves User Experience
Without proper error handling, users might encounter confusing or technical error messages. 
By catching and managing errors, developers can provide informative and user-friendly messages,
guiding users on the next steps or offering alternatives, thereby enhancing overall satisfaction.

3. Facilitates Debugging and Maintenance
Effective error handling aids developers in identifying and resolving issues efficiently.
By capturing error details—such as stack traces and error messages—developers can pinpoint 
the root causes of problems, making the debugging process more straightforward.

4. Ensures Security
Uncaught errors can expose sensitive information or leave applications in vulnerable states. 
Proper error handling prevents the leakage of stack traces or internal logic, safeguarding the application against potential security threats. 

5. Supports Asynchronous Operations
Modern JavaScript applications often rely on asynchronous operations like API calls.
 Using async/await combined with try...catch blocks ensures that errors in asynchronous code are handled appropriately, maintaining application reliability.

6. Promotes Maintainable Code
Structured error handling leads to cleaner and more organized codebases. 
By anticipating potential errors and managing them systematically, developers 
can create applications that are easier to maintain and scale over time.
