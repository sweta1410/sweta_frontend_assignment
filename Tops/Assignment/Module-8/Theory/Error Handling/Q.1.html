Q. What is error handling in JavaScript? Explain the try, catch, and finally blocks with an example.
Ans. In JavaScript, error handling ensures that your code can gracefully manage unexpected issues during execution, preventing the entire program from crashing. 
This is achieved using the try, catch, and finally blocks.

* try Block:-
The try block contains code that might throw an error. 
If an error occurs within this block, control is transferred to the catch block.

* catch Block:-
The catch block handles errors thrown in the try block. 
It receives an error object containing details about the error, such as its name and message.

* finally Block:-
The finally block contains code that executes after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an error was thrown or caught. 
This is typically used for cleanup operations, like closing files or releasing resources.

example:-
function divide(a, b) {
    try {
      if (b === 0) {
        throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero");
      }
      console.log("Result:", a / b);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error("Error:", err.message);
    } finally {
      console.log("Division attempt completed.");
    }
  }
  
  divide(10, 2); // Outputs: Result: 5
                 //          Division attempt completed.
  
  divide(10, 0); // Outputs: Error: Cannot divide by zero
                 //          Division attempt completed.
