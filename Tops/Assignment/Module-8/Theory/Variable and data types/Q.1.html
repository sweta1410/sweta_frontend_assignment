Q. What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare a variable using var, let, and const?
Ans. variables are containers used to store data values. They can hold various data types, such as numbers, strings, objects, or functions. 
JavaScript provides three primary keywords to declare variables: var, let, and const. 
Each has distinct characteristics regarding scope, hoisting, and mutability.

var: Function-Scoped Variable
Scope: Function-scoped. Variables declared with var are accessible throughout the
function in which they are defined.
Hoisting: Declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with undefined.
Re-declaration: Allowed within the same scope.
Re-assignment: Permitted.

2. let – Block-Scoped Variable
Scope: Block-scoped. Variables are accessible only within the block ({}) in which they are defined.
Hoisting: Declarations are hoisted but not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.
Re-declaration: Not allowed within the same scope.
Re-assignment: Permitted.

3. const – Block-Scoped Constant
Scope: Block-scoped, similar to let.
Hoisting: Declarations are hoisted but not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.
Re-declaration: Not allowed within the same scope.
Re-assignment: Not permitted. The variable must be initialized at the time of declaration.
