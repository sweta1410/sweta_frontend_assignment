How does the addEventListener() method work in JavaScript? Provide an example.
Ans. The addEventListener() method in JavaScript is used to attach an event handler 
to a specified element, allowing you to execute a function when a particular event occurs. This method provides a flexible way to handle events without overwriting existing event handlers.

Syntax:
element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);
event: A string representing the event type to listen for (e.g., 'click', 'mouseover').

function: The function to execute when the event occurs.

useCapture (optional): A boolean indicating whether to use event capturing. 
Defaults to false (event bubbling).

Example
Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use addEventListener() to change the
text of a paragraph when a button is clicked:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>addEventListener Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <button id="myButton">Click Me</button>
  <p id="myText">Hello, World!</p>

  <script>
    const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
    const text = document.getElementById('myText');

    button.addEventListener('click', function() {
      text.textContent = 'Button was clicked!';
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
In this example, when the button with the ID myButton is clicked, the text content 
of the paragraph with the ID myText changes to Button was clicked.

Event Propagation: Bubbling and Capturing
JavaScript events propagate through the DOM in two phases: capturing and bubbling.

Capturing Phase: The event starts from the root and travels down to the target element.

Bubbling Phase: The event starts from the target element and bubbles up to the root.

By default, addEventListener() uses the bubbling phase. To use the capturing phase, 
set the useCapture parameter to true. 

Advantages of addEventListener()
Multiple Handlers: Allows attaching multiple handlers to the same event on an element.

Separation of Concerns: Keeps HTML and JavaScript separate, enhancing maintainability.

Control Over Propagation: Provides options to control event propagation phases.

Flexibility: Can be used with various event types and on different DOM elements.
