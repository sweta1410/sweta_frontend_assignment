Q. What are JavaScript events? Explain the role of event listeners.
Ans. Events are occurrences that can be triggered by user actions (e.g., clicking a button, typing in a field) 
or by the browser itself (e.g., page load, window resize). When an event occurs, it can be captured and handled 
using JavaScript, allowing developers to define specific behaviors in response to these events.

* The Role of Event Listeners:
An event listener is a function that waits for a specific event to occur on a particular element. When the event happens, the listener executes a predefined function, known as an event handler. This mechanism allows developers to define interactive behaviors in response to user actions.

* Key Features of addEventListener():
Multiple Handlers: You can attach multiple event listeners of the same type to a single element without overwriting existing handlers.

Separation of Concerns: Using addEventListener() keeps JavaScript separate from HTML markup, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

Control Over Event Propagation: It provides control over how events propagate through the DOM, allowing for more precise event handling.
