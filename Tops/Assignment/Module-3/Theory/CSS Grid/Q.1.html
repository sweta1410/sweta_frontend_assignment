Explain CSS Grid and how it differs from Flexbox. When would you use Grid over Flexbox?
Ans. CSS Grid:
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to define both rows and columns. It enables precise placement of elements within a grid structure.

Features of CSS Grid:
 Works in two dimensions (rows & columns).
 Uses grid container (display: grid;) and grid items.
 Supports explicit (grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns) and implicit (grid-auto-rows, grid-auto-columns) grid definitions.
 Offers grid gap (gap, row-gap, column-gap) for spacing.
 Allows items to span multiple rows and columns using grid-column and grid-row.
 Supports alignment properties (justify-items, align-items, place-items).
 Has the fr (fractional unit), which dynamically distributes space.

 Flexbox:

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that aligns items either in a row or a column, but not both at the same time.

Features of Flexbox:
 Works in one dimension (either row or column).
 Uses a flex container (display: flex;) and flex items.
 Supports flexible sizing with flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.
 Uses justify-content, align-items, and align-self for alignment.
 Provides flex-wrap for wrapping elements onto new lines.

 Use Grid When:
- You need a structured layout with rows and columns (e.g., website layouts, dashboards).
- Elements need to span multiple rows or columns.
- You want precise control over placement.

Use Flexbox When:
- You have a simple row or column layout (e.g., navigation bars, form fields, buttons).
- You need dynamic and flexible sizing without a strict structure.
- You need to align content responsively.


* You can mix both systems. For example:
Use CSS Grid for the main layout structure.
Use Flexbox inside grid items to align content.
