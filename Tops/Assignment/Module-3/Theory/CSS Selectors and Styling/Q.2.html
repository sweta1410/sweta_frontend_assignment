Explain the concept of CSS specificity. How do conflicts between multiple styles get resolved?
Ans.  CSS Specificity: How Styles are Applied and Conflicts Resolved CSS specificity is a set of rules 
      that determine which styles take precedence when multiple styles target the same element. It is essentially a ranking system that resolves conflicts between competing CSS rules.

 How CSS Specificity Works:
Each CSS selector has a specificity value, which is calculated based on the type of selectors used. The more specific a selector, the higher its priority.

The specificity hierarchy is typically represented as (A, B, C, D):

A → Inline styles (highest priority)
B → ID selectors (#id)
C → Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes (.class, [attr], :hover)
D → Element selectors and pseudo-elements (div, h1, ::before)
Each selector type contributes to its respective category, and values are compared from left to right.

Specificity Calculation Example
Consider the following CSS:

css

/* Specificity: (0, 1, 0, 0) */
#main {
  color: red;
}

/* Specificity: (0, 0, 1, 0) */
.text {
  color: blue;
}

/* Specificity: (0, 0, 0, 1) */
p {
  color: green;
}

/* Specificity: (1, 0, 0, 0) */
<style>
  p {
    color: purple;
  }
</style>
If all these styles apply to the same <p class="text" id="main">, the winning color would be red because #main (ID selector) has the highest specificity.

  How Conflicts Are Resolved:
Higher Specificity Wins

A selector with higher specificity overrides one with lower specificity.
Equal Specificity: Last Rule Wins

If two selectors have the same specificity, the one that appears later in the CSS file takes precedence.
Inline Styles Override External and Internal Styles

Example:
html

<p style="color: orange;">This text is orange.</p>
Even if CSS defines p { color: blue; }, the inline style wins.
