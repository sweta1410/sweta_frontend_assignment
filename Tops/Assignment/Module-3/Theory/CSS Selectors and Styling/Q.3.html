What is the difference between internal, external, and inline CSS? Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
Ans.  1. Internal CSS:
Internal CSS is written inside the <style> tag within the <head> section of an HTML document.

Example:

<html>
<head>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: blue;
        }
        h1 {
            color: navy;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>

* Advantages:
Keeps styling in the same file, making it easier to manage for small projects.
No need for additional HTTP requests since the styles are within the HTML document.
Useful when styles are specific to a single page.

* Disadvantages:
Makes the HTML document larger, increasing load time.
Difficult to maintain for larger projects as styles cannot be shared across multiple pages.
Reduces the separation of concerns between content (HTML) and styling (CSS).

2. External CSS:
External CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.

Example:
styles.css

css

body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}
h1 {
    color: navy;
}
index.html

html

<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>

* Advantages:
Allows for consistent styling across multiple pages.
Keeps the HTML file clean and improves readability.
Enables faster loading of web pages since CSS files can be cached by browsers.
Encourages separation of concerns (HTML for content, CSS for styling).

* Disadvantages:
Requires an additional HTTP request to fetch the CSS file, which may slightly delay page load times.
If the external file is not loaded or is missing, the page will appear unstyled.
Initial setup takes slightly more effort compared to internal or inline CSS.

3. Inline CSS:
Inline CSS is applied directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute.

Example:
html

<html>
<body>
    <h1 style="color: navy; background-color: lightblue;">Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>

* Advantages:
Useful for applying quick fixes or styling specific elements.
No need for a separate CSS file, making it easy for small tweaks.
Overrides both internal and external styles due to its high specificity.

* Disadvantages:
Hard to maintain, especially for large projects.
Reduces code readability and increases redundancy.
Does not support CSS features like media queries, pseudo-classes, or reusability.
Bloats the HTML file and can make debugging difficult.
