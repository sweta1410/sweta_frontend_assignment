Explain the difference between web-safe fonts and custom web fonts. Why might you use a web-safe font over a custom font?
Ans.  1. Web-Safe Fonts:
Definition: Web-safe fonts are those that are universally available across all operating systems and devices. They are pre-installed on most computers and mobile devices.

Examples: Arial, Times New Roman, Courier New, Verdana, Georgia, etc.

Benefits:

Reliability: Since these fonts are already present on almost all systems, you can be sure that they will display consistently for all users.

Faster Loading: No additional resources need to be loaded from the web, so they can make your site load faster.

Compatibility: These fonts are well-supported across all browsers and devices without any need for additional CSS or HTML to link external font files.

2. Custom Web Fonts:

Definition: Custom web fonts are fonts that are not installed by default on a users device and must be downloaded from a server when the webpage is loaded. These fonts are often provided via services like Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts, or self-hosted font files.

Examples: Open Sans, Roboto, Lora, and many unique fonts available through these services.

Benefits:

Design Flexibility: Custom fonts allow you to create a unique look and feel for your website, supporting your brand's identity more effectively.

Expanded Choices: You have access to a much wider variety of fonts, including modern and artistic styles not available in the default web-safe set.

Consistency Across Devices: By using custom fonts, you ensure that your typography looks the same across all devices and platforms, as long as the font is properly loaded.

Why Might You Use a Web-Safe Font Over a Custom Font?

Here are some reasons why you might opt for a web-safe font instead of a custom font:

Faster Page Load Times: Since web-safe fonts are already installed on users' devices, you dont need to make additional HTTP requests to load font files. This can improve your website's load time and user experience, especially important for mobile users.

Compatibility and Reliability: Web-safe fonts ensure consistency across browsers and devices without worrying about font rendering issues or missing files. Custom fonts may fail to load if the user is offline or the external font service is down.

Performance on Low-bandwidth Connections: For users with slow or limited internet access, custom fonts can cause delays in loading the page. Using web-safe fonts eliminates this problem.

Simplicity and Minimalism: Some designs may not require fancy custom fonts, and using web-safe fonts might be more practical for simpler, straightforward websites or for content-heavy sites where typography is secondary to readability and performance.
