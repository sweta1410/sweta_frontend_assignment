What is CSS Flexbox, and how is it useful for layout design? Explain the terms
flex-container and flex-item.
Ans.  CSS Flexbox :
CSS Flexbox is a layout model in CSS that allows elements to be arranged efficiently inside a container, even if their sizes are dynamic. It provides a flexible way to distribute space and align content within a container, making it especially useful for designing responsive web pages.

Flexbox is particularly useful for:

- Aligning items vertically and horizontally
- Creating responsive layouts
- Distributing space efficiently among elements
- Handling dynamic content without using floats or positioning

*Terms in Flexbox:

1. Flex Container:
The flex container is the parent element that holds all the flex items. It is defined by applying display: flex; or display: inline-flex; to an element.

Example:
css

.container {
  display: flex;  
  flex-direction: row; 
}
html

<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="item">Item 3</div>
</div>

2. Flex Items
The flex items are the child elements inside the flex container. These items can be controlled using various flex properties like flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.

Example:
css

.item {
  flex: 1; 
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: blue;
}
